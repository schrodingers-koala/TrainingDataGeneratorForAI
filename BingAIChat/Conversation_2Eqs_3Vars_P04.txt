The problem can be solved using a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of oranges, apples, and strawberries bought by the shopper as o, a, and s respectively. Then we can write the following system of equations:

o + a + s = 14
0.42o + 0.5a + 0.55s = 6.52

Solving this system of equations, we get that the shopper bought 4 oranges, 5 apples, and 5 strawberries . Therefore, the total cost is 4*0.42 + 5*0.5 + 5*0.55 = 6.52 dollars.
