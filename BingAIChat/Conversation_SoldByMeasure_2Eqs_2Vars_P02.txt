The weight of one kiwifruit is 93 g. Strawberry is sold by 11 cm3. The weight of strawberry is 29/11 g per cm3.
The volume of one kiwifruit is 58 cm3.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 610 g.
The sum of volume is 345 cm3.

Let's denote the number of kiwifruits as (x) and the number of strawberries as (y). We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:
- Weight equation:
[93x + \frac{29}{11}y = 610]
- Volume equation:
[58x + 11y = 345]
To solve this system, we can multiply the second equation by 11 to make the coefficients of (y) match:
[11(58x) + 11(11y) = 11(345)]
[638x + 121y = 3795]
Now we can solve the system of equations. Let's multiply the first equation by 121 and subtract it from the second equation:
[638x + 121y - (93x + \frac{29}{11}y) = 3795 - 610]
[545x + \frac{121}{11}y = 3185]
To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 11:
[11(545x) + 121y = 11(3185)]
[5995x + 121y = 35035]
Now subtract the first equation from this new equation:
[5995x + 121y - (638x + 121y) = 35035 - 3795]
[5357x = 31240]
[x = \frac{31240}{5357} \approx 5.84]
Since the number of fruits must be a whole number, let's round down to 5 kiwifruits. Now we can find the number of strawberries:
[58x + 11y = 345]
[58(5) + 11y = 345]
[11y = 345 - 290]
[11y = 55]
[y = 5]
Therefore, the shopper buys approximately 5 kiwifruits and 5 strawberries. ü•ùüçì
