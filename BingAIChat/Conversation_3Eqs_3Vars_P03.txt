Let's assume that the shopper buys a apples, m melons, and k kiwifruits. We can then write the following system of equations:

a + m + k = 14
0.45a + 0.78m + 0.09k = 4.74
61a + 97m + 72k = 1086

We can solve this system of equations using matrix algebra. The solution is:

a = 6
m = 5
k = 3

Therefore, the shopper buys 6 apples, 5 melons, and 3 kiwifruits.
This is one possible solution to the problem.

According to the solution I provided earlier, the shopper buys 6 apples, 5 melons, and 3 kiwifruits. The total price of this purchase can be calculated as follows:

Total price = (Price of 1 apple * Number of apples) + (Price of 1 melon * Number of melons) + (Price of 1 kiwifruit * Number of kiwifruits)
            = (0.45 * 6) + (0.78 * 5) + (0.09 * 3)
            = 2.70 + 3.90 + 0.27
            = 7.87 cents

Therefore, the total price of the shopper's purchase is 7.87 cents.
