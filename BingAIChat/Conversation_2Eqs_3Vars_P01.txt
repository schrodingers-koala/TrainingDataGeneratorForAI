Let's assume that the shopper buys x kiwifruits, y oranges, and z blueberries.
From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:

x + y + z = 5
56x + 44y + 40z = 240

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.
Multiplying the first equation by 40 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get:

56x + 44y + 40z = 240
-40x - 40y - 40z = -200
-------------------------
16x + 4y = 40

Simplifying further, we get:

4x + y = 10

Now, we can substitute this value of y in the first equation to get:

x + z = 5 - y
x + z = 5 - (4x + y)
5x + z = 5
z = 5 - 5x

Therefore, we have:

y = 10 - 4x
z = 5 - 5x

Since the shopper buys a total of 5 fruits, we have:

x + y + z = 5
x + (10 - 4x) + (5 - 5x) = 5
2x = 0
x = 0

Thus, the shopper buys 0 kiwifruits, 10 oranges, and 5 blueberries.
Therefore, one possible solution is that the shopper buys 0 kiwifruits, 10 oranges, and 5 blueberries.
