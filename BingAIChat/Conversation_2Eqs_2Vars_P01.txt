This is a classic problem in algebra. Let's assume that the shopper bought x kiwifruits and y grapes.
From the problem statement, we know that:
- The price of kiwifruit is 34 cents.
- The price of grape is 36 cents.
- The number of fruits is 4.
- The sum of price is 144 cents.
We can write two equations based on the above information:
- x + y = 4 (since the total number of fruits bought is 4)
- 34x + 36y = 144 (since the total cost of fruits bought is 144 cents)
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y. One way to do this is to use substitution method. We can solve equation (1) for x in terms of y:
x = 4 - y
Substitute this value of x in equation (2):
34(4 - y) + 36y = 144
Simplifying this equation, we get:
-2y + 136 = 144
-2y = 8
y = -4
This solution doesn't make sense because we can't have negative number of grapes. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.
I hope this helps!
