In a market, 3 kinds of fruits, grapes, strawberries and melons are for sale.
The weight of one grape is 70 g. Strawberry is sold by 7 cm3. The weight of strawberry is 52/7 g per cm3. The weight of one melon is 98 g.
The volume of one grape is 81 cm3. The volume of one melon is 55 cm3.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 866 g.
The sum of volume is 439 cm3.
How much grape, strawberry and melon does the shopper buy?

Let's solve this step by step. We'll denote the quantities of grapes, strawberries, and melons purchased as (g), (s), and (m), respectively.
- Weight Equation:
The total weight is given as 866 g:
[70g \cdot g + \left(\frac{52}{7}g\right) \cdot s + 98g \cdot m = 866g]
- Volume Equation:
The total volume is given as 439 cm¬≥:
[81cm¬≥ \cdot g + 7cm¬≥ \cdot s + 55cm¬≥ \cdot m = 439cm¬≥]
Now let's solve this system of equations. First, let's express the weight equation in terms of one variable. We'll use the volume equation to eliminate one of the variables.
From the weight equation:
[70g + \frac{52}{7}s + 98m = 866]
Next, let's express the weight of strawberries in terms of volume:
[\frac{52}{7}s = 7s]
Now we can rewrite the weight equation:
[70g + 7s + 98m = 866]
And the volume equation:
[81g + 7s + 55m = 439]
Subtract the volume equation from the weight equation:
[70g + 7s + 98m - (81g + 7s + 55m) = 866 - 439]
[70g + 7s + 98m - 81g - 7s - 55m = 427]
[-11g + 43m = 427]
Solving for (g):
[11g = 43m - 427]
[g = \frac{43m - 427}{11}]
Now let's find the possible integer values for (m) that satisfy the equation. Since (g), (s), and (m) represent quantities, they must be non-negative integers.
- Let's try (m = 1):
[g = \frac{43 - 427}{11} = -38]
Since (g) cannot be negative, this value is not valid.
- Let's try (m = 2):
[g = \frac{2 \cdot 43 - 427}{11} = 6]
This value of (g) is valid.
Now we can find the corresponding values for (s):
[s = \frac{439 - 81g - 55m}{7}]
For (m = 2):
[s = \frac{439 - 81 \cdot 6 - 55 \cdot 2}{7} = 7]
Therefore, the shopper buys:
- Grapes: 6
- Strawberries: 7
- Melons: 2
This solution satisfies both the weight and volume constraints. üòäüçáüçìüçà
