The shopper buys 1 orange, 2 strawberries, 8 grapes, and 0 melons.
Here's how we can arrive at this solution:
- Let's assume the shopper buys o oranges, s strawberries, g grapes, and m melons.
- We know that the total number of fruits bought is 11. Therefore, we can write:
o + s + g + m = 11
- We also know that the total cost of the fruits is 156 cents. Therefore, we can write:
10o + 15s + 3g + 36m = 156
- We can solve these equations to get:
o = 1
s = 2
g = 8
m = 0
Therefore, the shopper buys 1 orange, 2 strawberries, 8 grapes, and 0 melons.
