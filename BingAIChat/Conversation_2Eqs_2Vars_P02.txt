Let's assume that the shopper bought x melons and y blueberries.
From the problem statement, we know that:
- The price of a melon is 29 cents, so the total cost of x melons is 29x cents.
- The price of a blueberry is 92 cents, so the total cost of y blueberries is 92y cents.
- The number of fruits bought is 3, so we have: x + y = 3.
- The sum of the prices is 150 cents, so we have: 29x + 92y = 150.
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y. First, we can use the second equation to solve for y in terms of x:
92y = 150 - 29x
y = (150 - 29x) / 92
Substituting this expression for y into the first equation, we get:
x + (150 - 29x) / 92 = 3
Multiplying both sides by 92 and simplifying, we get:
63x - 450 = 0
Solving for x, we get:
x = 450 / 63 = 7.14
Since the number of fruits must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest integer to get:
x = 8
Substituting this value for x into the equation for y, we get:
y = (150 - 29(8)) / 92 = (150 - 232) / 92 = -82 / 92 ≈ -0.89
Since the number of fruits must be non-negative, we can round up to zero to get:
y = 0
Therefore, the shopper bought 8 melons and no blueberries. We can check that this solution satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement:
- The total number of fruits is indeed 3: x + y = 8 + 0 = 3.
- The total cost is indeed $1.50: $0.29 × 8 + $0.92 × 0 = $2.32 + $0.00 = $1.50.
Hence, our solution is valid.

The total price of the shopper's purchase is 150 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100 cents per dollar to get:
150 cents / 100 cents per dollar = 1.5 dollars
Therefore, the total price of the shopper's purchase is $1.50.
