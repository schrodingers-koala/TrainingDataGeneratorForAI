Let's assume that the shopper buys a apples, m melons, and o oranges. We can then write the following system of equations:

a + m + o = 8
57a + 59m + 15o = 374
88a + 13m + 6o = 465

We can solve this system of equations using matrix algebra. The solution is:

a = 3
m = 2
o = 3

Therefore, the shopper buys 3 apples, 2 melons, and 3 oranges. One possible way to check this solution is to verify that it satisfies all three equations in the system.
