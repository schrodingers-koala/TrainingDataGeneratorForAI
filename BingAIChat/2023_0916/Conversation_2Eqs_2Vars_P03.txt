The shopper bought 2 apples and 8 melons.
Here's how we can solve the problem:
- Let's assume that the shopper bought x apples and y melons.
- We know that the total number of fruits is 10. Therefore, x + y = 10.
- We also know that the total cost of fruits is 790 cents. Therefore, 80x + 78y = 790.
- Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 2 and y = 8.
Therefore, the shopper bought 2 apples and 8 melons.
