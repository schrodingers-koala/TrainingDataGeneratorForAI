Let's solve this problem step by step.
Let's assume that the shopper buys x strawberries, y kiwifruits, and z blueberries.
From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:

x + y + z = 17
87x + 58y + 73z = 1135
54x + 66y + 19z = 734

We can solve this system of equations using matrix algebra. The solution is:

x = 5
y = 6
z = 6

Therefore, the shopper buys 5 strawberries, 6 kiwifruits, and 6 blueberries.
I hope this helps!
