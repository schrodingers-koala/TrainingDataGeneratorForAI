Let's assume that the shopper buys x oranges, y grapes, z apples, and w melons. We can then write the following system of equations:

x + y + z + w = 13
0.73x + 0.88y + 0.85z + 0.71w = 10.78
32x + 21y + 49z + 2w = 373

We can solve this system of equations using matrix algebra or substitution. Here, we will use substitution.
From the first equation, we can solve for w in terms of x, y, and z:

w = 13 - x - y - z

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

0.73x + 0.88y + 0.85z + 0.71(13 - x - y - z) = 10.78

Simplifying and solving for z, we get:

0.14z = 1.35
z = 9.64

Since we need a whole number of apples, let's round z down to 9.
Substituting this value into the third equation, we get:

32x + 21y + 49(9) + 2w = 373
32x + 21y + 2w = 132

We can solve for w in terms of x and y:

w = (132 - 32x - 21y) / 2

Since we need a whole number of melons, let's check which values of x and y give us a whole number for w.
If we try x=1 and y=3, we get:

w = (132 - 32(1) - 21(3)) / 2 = (132 - 32 - 63) / 2 = 17/2

This is not a whole number, so let's try another combination.
If we try x=2 and y=3, we get:

w = (132 - 32(2) - 21(3)) / 2 = (132 - 64 - 63) / 2 = 5/2

This is also not a whole number, so let's try another combination.
If we try x=3 and y=3, we get:

w = (132 - 32(3) - 21(3)) / 2 = (132 - 96 - 63) / 2 = -13/2

This is not a valid solution since we can't have a negative number of melons.
If we try x=4 and y=3, we get:

w = (132 - 32(4) - 21(3)) / 2 = (132 -128 -63) /2 =0.5

This is also not a whole number, so let's try another combination.
If we try x=1 and y=4, we get:

w = (132 -32(1) -21(4))/2=(132-32-84)/2=8

So the shopper bought:
- 1 orange for 73 cents.
- 4 grapes for 88*4=352 cents.
- 9 apples for 85*9=765 cents.
- 8 melons for 71*8=568 cents.
Therefore, the total price is 73+352+765+568=1758 cents or $17.58.
