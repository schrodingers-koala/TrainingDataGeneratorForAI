Let's assume that the shopper buys a apples, k kiwifruits, g grapes, and o oranges.
From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:
a + k + g + o = 19  (1)
0.38a + 0.91k + 0.06g + 0.91o = 11.98  (2)
We can solve this system of equations using substitution method.
From equation (1), we can express a in terms of k, g, and o:
a = 19 - k - g - o
Substituting this expression for a in equation (2), we get:
0.38(19 - k - g - o) + 0.91k + 0.06g + 0.91o = 11.98
Simplifying and rearranging the terms, we get:
-0.38k - 0.38g - 0.38o = -1.16   (3)
Now, we can express k in terms of g and o from equation (3):
k = (1/0.38)(-1.16 + 0.38g + 0.38o)
Substituting this expression for k in equation (1), we get:
a + (1/0.38)(-1.16 + 0.38g + 0.38o) + g + o = 19
Simplifying and rearranging the terms, we get:
a = (1/0.38)(20.16 - g - o)
Now, we can express a in terms of g and o:
a = (1/0.38)(20.16 - g - o)
k = (1/0.38)(-1.16 + 0.38g + 0.38o)
We know that the shopper buys whole fruits only, so a, k, g, and o must be integers.
We can use trial and error to find one possible solution that satisfies all the conditions.
One possible solution is:
- a = 5
- k = 6
- g = 2
- o = 6
Therefore, the shopper buys 5 apples, 6 kiwifruits, 2 grapes, and 6 oranges.
Please note that there may be other possible solutions as well.
