The price of strawberry is 94 cents. The price of orange is 32 cents. The price of apple is 91 cents.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The number of fruits is 11.
The sum of price is 476 cents.

Let's assume that the shopper buys x strawberries, y oranges, and z apples.
From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:

x + y + z = 11
94x + 32y + 91z = 476

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.
Multiplying the first equation by 32 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get:

94x + 32y + 91z = 476
-32x - 32y - 32z = -352
------------------------
62x       + 59z = 124

Now, we can use the first equation to express y in terms of x and z:

y = 11 - x - z

Substituting this expression into the above equation, we get:

62x + 59z = 124 - 32(11 - x - z)
62x + 59z = -292 + 91x + 91z
31x - 32z = -416

Solving this equation for x, we get:

x = (59/93)z - (416/93)

Since x and y must be non-negative integers, we can try different values of z and check if x and y are integers.
If we set z to be a multiple of 93 (the denominator of the coefficient of z in the above equation), then x will be an integer. For example, if we set z to be 93, then:

x = (59/93)(93) - (416/93) = 3

Substituting this value of x into the first equation, we get:

3 + y + 93 = 11
y = -85

This is not a valid solution since y must be non-negative. Therefore, there is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions.
Thus, there is no combination of strawberries, oranges, and apples that the shopper could have bought to satisfy all the given conditions.
