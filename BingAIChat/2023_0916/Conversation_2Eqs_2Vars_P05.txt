Let's assume that the shopper bought x blueberries and y melons.
From the problem statement, we know that:
- The price of a blueberry is 61 cents.
- The price of a melon is 25 cents.
- The shopper bought 7 fruits in total.
- The sum of the prices is 355 cents.
We can write two equations to represent the above information:

x + y = 7
0.61x + 0.25y = 3.55

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.
Multiplying the first equation by 25, we get:

25x + 25y = 175

Subtracting this from the second equation, we get:

0.36x = -0.8

Solving for x, we get:

x = -2.22

This is not a valid solution since we cannot have a negative number of blueberries. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.
Alternatively, we can solve this problem using matrices. We can write the system of equations in matrix form as:

[1   1] [x]   [7]
[0.61 0.25] [y] = [3.55]

Multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient matrix, we get:

[x]   [7/0.36]    [1/0.36]
[y] = [-19/36]    [61/144]

Therefore, the solution is:

x = 19/36 ≈ 0.53 ≈ 1 (rounded to nearest integer)
y = 61/144 ≈ 0.42 ≈ 0 (rounded to nearest integer)

So, the shopper bought 1 blueberry and 0 melons.
