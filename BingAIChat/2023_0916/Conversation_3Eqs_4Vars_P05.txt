Let's assume that the shopper buys a, g, m, and s number of apples, grapes, melons, and strawberries, respectively. Then we can write the following system of equations:

a + g + m + s = 27
67a + 51g + 91m + 36s = 1634
71a + 6g + 76m + 66s = 1647

We can solve this system of equations to get:

a = 6
g = 3
m = 10
s = 8

Therefore, the shopper buys 6 apples, 3 grapes, 10 melons, and 8 strawberries .
