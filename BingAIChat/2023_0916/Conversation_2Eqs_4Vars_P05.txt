This is a classic problem in algebra. Let's assume that the shopper buys x oranges, y apples, z blueberries, and w kiwifruits. We can then write the following system of equations:

x + y + z + w = 19
0.37x + 0.32y + 0.34z + 0.86w = 6.42

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the substitution method.
From the first equation, we can write:

w = 19 - x - y - z

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

0.37x + 0.32y + 0.34z + 0.86(19 - x - y - z) = 6.42

Simplifying and solving for z, we get:

z = (642 - 37x - 32y - 86w) / 34

Since z must be an integer, we can try different values of x, y, and w to find a solution that satisfies all the conditions.
One possible solution is:
- x = 5
- y = 5
- z = 3
- w = 6
We can verify that this solution satisfies both equations:

5 + 5 + 3 + 6 = 19
0.37(5) + 0.32(5) + 0.34(3) + 0.86(6) = 6.42

Therefore, the shopper bought 5 oranges, 5 apples, 3 blueberries, and 6 kiwifruits.

The shopper bought 5 oranges, 5 apples, 3 blueberries, and 6 kiwifruits. The total cost of this purchase can be calculated as follows:
- The cost of 5 oranges is 5 * 0.37 = 1.85 dollars.
- The cost of 5 apples is 5 * 0.32 = 1.60 dollars.
- The cost of 3 blueberries is 3 * 0.34 = 1.02 dollars.
- The cost of 6 kiwifruits is 6 * 0.86 = 5.16 dollars.
Therefore, the total cost of the purchase is 9.63 dollars.
