In a market, 3 kinds of fruits, blueberries, apples and strawberries are for sale.
The weight of one apple is 16 g. Strawberry is sold by 44 cm3. The weight of strawberry is 29/44 g per cm3.
Blueberry is sold by 65 g. The volume of blueberry is 29/65 cm3 per g. The volume of one apple is 27 cm3.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 802 g.
The sum of volume is 754 cm3.
How much blueberry, apple and strawberry does the shopper buy?

Let's find a solution for the shopper's fruit purchase! We have three types of fruits: blueberries, apples, and strawberries. Here's what we know:
- Apple:
    - Weight of one apple: 16 g
    - Volume of one apple: 27 cm³
- Strawberry:
    - Sold by volume: 44 cm³
    - Weight of strawberry per cm³: 29/44 g/cm³
- Blueberry:
    - Sold by weight: 65 g
    - Volume of blueberry per gram: 29/65 cm³/g
The shopper's total weight is 802 g, and the total volume is 754 cm³. Let's set up equations for the total weight and volume:
- Weight equation:
    - Weight of apples + Weight of strawberries + Weight of blueberries = 802 g
    - (16a + \frac{29}{44}s + 65b = 802)
- Volume equation:
    - Volume of apples + Volume of strawberries + Volume of blueberries = 754 cm³
    - (27a + 44s + \frac{29}{65}b = 754)
Now let's solve this system of equations to find the values of (a) (apples), (s) (strawberries), and (b) (blueberries). I'll use substitution or elimination to find a solution. Calculating the exact values might be a bit complex, but we can approximate them.
Let's proceed with the calculations! 🍎🍓🫐

Let's solve the system of equations for the shopper's fruit purchase. We have:
- Weight equation:
    - (16a + \frac{29}{44}s + 65b = 802)
- Volume equation:
    - (27a + 44s + \frac{29}{65}b = 754)
To make the calculations more manageable, let's multiply both equations by their respective denominators (44 and 65) to eliminate fractions:
- Weight equation (multiplied by 44):
    - (704a + 29s + 2860b = 35288)
- Volume equation (multiplied by 65):
    - (1755a + 2860s + 44b = 49010)
Now, let's solve this system of equations. Subtract 44 times the weight equation from 65 times the volume equation:
[ 65(1755a + 2860s + 44b) - 44(704a + 29s + 2860b) = 49010 - 35288 ]
Solving this yields:
[ 115000s = 13722 ]
Therefore, the value of (s) (strawberries) is approximately:
[ s \approx \frac{13722}{115000} ]
Similarly, we can find the values of (a) (apples) and (b) (blueberries). Let me calculate those for you! 🍎🍓🫐
