Let's assume that the shopper buys x apples, y grapes, and z strawberries. We can then write the following system of equations:

x + y + z = 15
0.62x + 0.26y + 0.72z = 9.08
x + 46y + 73z = 465

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method to solve for y and z:

0.62x + 0.26y + 0.72z = 9.08
x + 46y + 73z = 465

Multiplying the first equation by -46 and adding it to the second equation, we get:

-28.52x - 33.92z = -293.8

Simplifying, we get:

14.26x + 16.96z = 146.9

Multiplying the first equation by -72 and adding it to the third equation, we get:

-71x - 26y = -255

Simplifying, we get:

71x + 26y = 255

Multiplying this equation by 14.26/26, we get:

3.89x + 1.78y = 16.2

Multiplying the first equation by -1.78 and adding it to the above equation, we get:

1.11x + 3.18z = 8.5

Now we have two equations with two variables that we can solve using substitution method.

From the first equation, we can write:

y = (465 - x - z)/46

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

0.62x + 0.26((465 - x - z)/46) + 0.72z = 9.08

Simplifying, we get:

13x + 29z = 1264

Substituting `1.11x + 3.18z = 8.5` into the above equation, we get:

13(1.11x + 3.18z) + 29z = 1264

Simplifying, we get:

14.43x + 42.34z = 1466

Multiplying `1.11x + 3.18z = 8.5` by -14.43 and adding it to the above equation, we get:

-28.52z = -293.8

Solving for **z**, we get:

z = (2938/2852) ≈ **1**

Substituting this value into `1.11x + 3.18z = 8.5`, we get:

x ≈ **4**

Finally, substituting these values into `x + y + z = 15`, we get:

y ≈ **10**

Therefore, the shopper buys approximately **4 apples**, **10 grapes**, and **1 strawberry**.
