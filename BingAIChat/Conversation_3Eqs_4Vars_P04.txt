Let's assume that the shopper buys x blueberries, y kiwifruits, z apples, and w melons.
From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:

x + y + z + w = 11
85x + 88y + 82z + 25w = 647
18x + 93y + 18z + 11w = 463

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x, y, z, and w. One possible solution is:

x = 1
y = 4
z = 2
w = 4

Therefore, the shopper buys 1 blueberry, 4 kiwifruits, 2 apples, and 4 melons.
Note that there may be other possible solutions as well.
