In a market, 2 kinds of fruits, kiwifruits and blueberries are for sale.
The weight of one kiwifruit is 21 g.
The volume of one kiwifruit is 56 cm3. Blueberry is sold by 73 g. The volume of blueberry is 84/73 cm3 per g.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 303 g.
The sum of volume is 476 cm3.
How much kiwifruit and blueberry does the shopper buy?

Let's denote the weight of kiwifruits as (x) (in grams) and the weight of blueberries as (y) (in grams). We have the following information:
- Weight of one kiwifruit: (21) g
- Volume of one kiwifruit: (56) cm¬≥
- Blueberries are sold by weight: (73) g
- Volume of blueberries per gram: (\frac{84}{73}) cm¬≥/g
- Total weight bought by the shopper: (x + y = 303) g
- Total volume bought by the shopper: (56x + \frac{84}{73}y = 476) cm¬≥
We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:
[
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 303 \
56x + \frac{84}{73}y &= 476
\end{align*}
]
To solve this system, we can multiply the second equation by (73) to get rid of the fraction:
[
\begin{align*}
73(56x) + 84y &= 73(476) \
3944x + 84y &= 34748
\end{align*}
]
Now let's solve this system of equations. Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:
[
\begin{align*}
3944x + 84y - (x + y) &= 34748 - 303 \
3943x + 83y &= 34445
\end{align*}
]
Next, solve for (y):
[
\begin{align*}
83y &= 34445 - 3943x \
y &= \frac{34445 - 3943x}{83}
\end{align*}
]
Substitute this expression for (y) back into the first equation:
[
x + \frac{34445 - 3943x}{83} = 303
]
Multiply both sides of the equation by (83) to eliminate the fraction:
[
83x + 34445 - 3943x = 83 \cdot 303
]
Solving for (x):
[
3943x = 34445 - 83 \cdot 303
]
[
x = \frac{34445 - 83 \cdot 303}{3943}
]
Now calculate the value of (x). Once we have (x), we can find (y) using the first equation:
[
y = 303 - x
]
I'll calculate the values for you. Give me a moment.

Certainly! Let's find the solution.
Given the system of equations:
[
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 303 \
56x + \frac{84}{73}y &= 476
\end{align*}
]
First, let's eliminate the fraction in the second equation. Multiply both sides of the second equation by (73):
[
73(56x) + 84y = 73(476) \
3944x + 84y = 34748
]
Now subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:
[
3943x + 83y = 34445
]
Solving for (y):
[
y = \frac{34445 - 3943x}{83}
]
Next, substitute this expression for (y) back into the first equation:
[
x + \frac{34445 - 3943x}{83} = 303
]
Multiply both sides by (83) to eliminate the fraction:
[
83x + 34445 - 3943x = 83 \cdot 303
]
Solving for (x):
[
x = \frac{34445 - 83 \cdot 303}{3943}
]
Calculating the value of (x), we get:
[ x \approx 7.5 ]
Now find (y):
[ y = 303 - x ]
[ y \approx 295.5 ]
Therefore, the shopper buys approximately 7.5 g of kiwifruit and 295.5 g of blueberries. ü•ùü´ê
