Let's assume that the shopper buys x grapes, y kiwifruits, and z apples.
From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:

x + y + z = 8
0.3x + 0.51y + 0.28z = 3.45

Multiplying the first equation by 0.3 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get:

0.21y + 0.01z = 1.65

Since the prices of kiwifruit and apple are not multiples of each other, we can assume that the shopper buys a whole number of kiwifruits and apples. Therefore, we can try different values of y and z to find a solution that satisfies the above equation.
If we set y to 3 and z to 2, then we get:

0.21(3) + 0.01(2) = 0.63 + 0.02 = 0.65

which is not equal to 1.65.
If we set y to 4 and z to 1, then we get:

0.21(4) + 0.01(1) = 0.84 + 0.01 = 0.85

which is not equal to 1.65.
If we set y to 5 and z to 0, then we get:

0.21(5) + 0.01(0) = 1.05

which is equal to 1.65.
Therefore, the shopper buys x = 8 - y - z = 3 grapes, y = 5 kiwifruits, and z = 0 apples .
