Let's assume that the shopper buys x oranges, y apples, z blueberries, and w grapes.
From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:

x + y + z + w = 20
30x + 4y + 29z + 91w = 358

We can solve this system of equations using substitution method.
First, we can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for x in terms of y, z, and w from the first equation:

x = 20 - y - z - w

Substituting this expression for x in the second equation, we get:

30(20 - y - z - w) + 4y + 29z + 91w = 358

Simplifying this equation, we get:

600 - 30y - 30z - 30w + 4y + 29z + 91w = 358

Rearranging and simplifying further, we get:

-26y - w = -242

We can solve for w in terms of y from this equation:

w = 26y + 242

Since the number of fruits is given as 20, we know that:

x + y + z + w = 20

Substituting the expression for x and w, we get:

(20 - y - z - (26y + 242)) + y + z + (26y + 242) = 20

Simplifying this equation, we get:

27y = -222

This is not a valid solution since the number of fruits cannot be negative. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.
Alternatively, we could have solved this system of equations using elimination method or matrix method. However, substitution method was more straightforward in this case.
