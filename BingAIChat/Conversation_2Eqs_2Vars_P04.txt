Let's assume that the shopper buys x blueberries and y kiwifruits.
From the problem statement, we know that:
- The price of a blueberry is 40 cents, so the total cost of x blueberries is 40x cents.
- The price of a kiwifruit is 79 cents, so the total cost of y kiwifruits is 79y cents.
- The number of fruits bought is 14, so we have x + y = 14.
- The sum of the prices is 911 cents, so we have 40x + 79y = 911.
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.
Multiplying the first equation by 40 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get:
39y = 271
Therefore, y = 7.
Substituting y = 7 into x + y = 14, we get:
x + 7 = 14
Therefore, x = 7.
So the shopper bought 7 blueberries and 7 kiwifruits.
We can check that this solution satisfies both equations:
40x + 79y = (40 * 7) + (79 * 7) = 280 + 553 = 833
x + y = 7 + 7 = 14
Therefore, this is one possible solution to the problem.
