In a market, 4 kinds of fruits, apples, strawberries, blueberries and grapes are for sale.
The weight of one apple is 9 g. Strawberry is sold by 99 cm3. The weight of strawberry is 19/33 g per cm3. The weight of one grape is 22 g.
The volume of one apple is 38 cm3. Blueberry is sold by 93 g. The volume of blueberry is 46/93 cm3 per g. The volume of one grape is 62 cm3.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 594 g.
The sum of volume is 1077 cm3.

Certainly! Let's find a solution for the shopper's fruit purchases. We have the following information:
- Weights:
    - Apple weight: 9 g
    - Strawberry weight per cm³: 19/33 g
    - Grape weight: 22 g
- Volumes:
    - Apple volume: 38 cm³
    - Blueberry volume per g: 46/93 cm³
    - Grape volume: 62 cm³
The shopper buys a total of 594 g of fruit and the total volume is 1077 cm³. Let's denote the quantities of each fruit as follows:
- (a): Apples
- (s): Strawberries
- (b): Blueberries
- (g): Grapes
We can set up the following equations:
- Weight equation:
[9a + \frac{19}{33}s + 22g = 594]
- Volume equation:
[38a + \frac{46}{93}b + 62g = 1077]
Now let's solve this system of equations. First, let's express the strawberry weight in terms of volume:
[\frac{19}{33}s = \frac{19}{33} \cdot 99s = 19s]
Next, let's express the blueberry volume in terms of weight:
[\frac{46}{93}b = \frac{46}{93} \cdot 93b = 46b]
Now we have the simplified equations:
- Weight equation:
[9a + 19s + 22g = 594]
- Volume equation:
[38a + 46b + 62g = 1077]
Let's solve this system of equations. I'll use the substitution method:
- Solve the weight equation for (s):
[s = \frac{594 - 9a - 22g}{19}]
- Substitute the expression for (s) into the volume equation:
[38a + 46b + 62g = 1077]
[38a + 46b + 62g = 1077]
- Solve for (g):
[g = \frac{1077 - 38a - 46b}{62}]
- Substitute the expression for (g) back into the weight equation:
[9a + 19s + 22\left(\frac{1077 - 38a - 46b}{62}\right) = 594]
- Simplify and solve for (a):
[a = 6]
Now that we have the value of (a), we can find the quantities of the other fruits:
- Apples ((a)): 6
- Strawberries ((s)): 99 - 19(a) = 99 - 19(6) = 3
- Blueberries ((b)): 93 - 46(a) = 93 - 46(6) = 3
- Grapes ((g)): 1077 - 38(a) - 62(b) = 1077 - 38(6) - 62(3) = 6
Therefore, the shopper buys 6 apples, 3 strawberries, 3 blueberries, and 6 grapes. 🍎🍓🫐🍇

Please calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume for your solution.

Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume for the solution we found:
- Sum of Weight:
    - Apples: (6 \times 9) g = 54 g
    - Strawberries: (3 \times \frac{19}{33}) g = 17 g
    - Blueberries: (3 \times 93) g = 279 g
    - Grapes: (6 \times 22) g = 132 g
    - Total weight: (54 + 17 + 279 + 132 = 482) g
- Sum of Volume:
    - Apples: (6 \times 38) cm³ = 228 cm³
    - Blueberries: (3 \times \frac{46}{93}) cm³ = 138 cm³
    - Grapes: (6 \times 62) cm³ = 372 cm³
    - Total volume: (228 + 138 + 372 = 738) cm³
Therefore, the shopper buys a total weight of 482 g and a total volume of 738 cm³. 🛒🍎🍓🫐🍇
