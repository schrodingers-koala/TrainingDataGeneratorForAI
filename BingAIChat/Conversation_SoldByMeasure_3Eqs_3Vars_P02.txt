Let's break this down step by step. We'll find the quantities of each fruit the shopper buys.
- Strawberries:
    - Price per cmÂ³: $$\frac{10}{13}$$ cents
    - Weight per cmÂ³: $$\frac{25}{91}$$ g
    - Let the quantity of strawberries be (x).
    - Total cost for strawberries: $$\frac{10}{13} \cdot 91x = 910x$$ cents
    - Total weight of strawberries: $$\frac{25}{91} \cdot 91x = 25x$$ g
- Blueberries:
    - Price per g: $$\frac{23}{19}$$ cents
    - Volume per g: $$\frac{4}{19}$$ cmÂ³
    - Let the quantity of blueberries be (y).
    - Total cost for blueberries: $$\frac{23}{19} \cdot 38y = 874y$$ cents
    - Total volume of blueberries: $$\frac{4}{19} \cdot 38y = 8y$$ cmÂ³
- Grapes:
    - Price per grape: 34 cents
    - Let the quantity of grapes be (z).
    - Total cost for grapes: (34z) cents
    - Total volume of grapes: (2z) cmÂ³
Now, let's set up the equations based on the given information:
- Total cost: (910x + 874y + 34z = 414) cents
- Total weight: (25x + 204y + 0z = 204) g
- Total volume: (8y + 2z = 214) cmÂ³
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (x), (y), and (z). One possible solution is:
- (x = 2) (strawberries)
- (y = 5) (blueberries)
- (z = 102) (grapes)
Therefore, the shopper buys 2 units of strawberries, 5 units of blueberries, and 102 grapes.

Please calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume for your solution.

Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume for the solution:
- Sum of Weight:
    - Strawberries weight: (25x = 25 \cdot 2 = 50) g
    - Blueberries weight: (204y = 204 \cdot 5 = 1020) g
    - Grapes weight: (0z = 0) g (since grapes have no weight)
    - Total weight: (50 + 1020 + 0 = 1070) g
- Sum of Volume:
    - Blueberries volume: (8y = 8 \cdot 5 = 40) cmÂ³
    - Grapes volume: (2z = 2 \cdot 102 = 204) cmÂ³
    - Total volume: (40 + 204 = 244) cmÂ³
Therefore, the shopper buys a total weight of 1070 g and a total volume of 244 cmÂ³.
