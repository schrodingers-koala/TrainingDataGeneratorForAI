Let's assume that the shopper buys x strawberries, y blueberries, z apples, and w oranges.
From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:

x + y + z + w = 23
97x + 43y + 25z + 34w = 1124

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x, y, z, and w. One possible solution is:

x = 7
y = 6
z = 5
w = 5

Therefore, the shopper buys 7 strawberries, 6 blueberries, 5 apples, and 5 oranges.
We can verify that this solution satisfies both equations:

7 + 6 + 5 + 5 = 23
97(7) + 43(6) + 25(5) + 34(5) = 1124

Hence, we have found one possible solution to the problem.

The shopper buys 7 strawberries, 6 blueberries, 5 apples, and 5 oranges.
To calculate the total price of the fruits, we can multiply the number of each fruit by its respective price and then add up the results. Using the given prices, we get:

7 strawberries x 97 cents/strawberry = 679 cents
6 blueberries x 43 cents/blueberry = 258 cents
5 apples x 25 cents/apple = 125 cents
5 oranges x 34 cents/orange = 170 cents

Therefore, the total price of the fruits is 1232 cents or $12.32.
Please note that this is just one possible solution to the problem, and there may be other valid solutions as well.
