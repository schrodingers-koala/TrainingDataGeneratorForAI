In a market, 3 kinds of fruits, strawberries, oranges and blueberries are for sale.
Strawberry is sold by 23 cm3. The weight of strawberry is 64/23 g per cm3. The weight of one orange is 97 g.
The volume of one orange is 66 cm3. Blueberry is sold by 73 g. The volume of blueberry is 29/73 cm3 per g.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 1484 g.
The sum of volume is 680 cm3.
How much strawberry, orange and blueberry does the shopper buy?

Let's find a solution for the shopper's fruit purchases. We'll denote the quantities of strawberries, oranges, and blueberries as (S), (O), and (B), respectively.
Given the information:
- The weight of strawberries is (\frac{64}{23}) g/cm³, and they are sold by volume (23 cm³).
- The weight of oranges is 97 g, and their volume is 66 cm³.
- Blueberries are sold by weight (73 g), and their volume is (\frac{29}{73}) cm³ per gram.
We can set up the following equations based on the total weight and volume:
- Weight equation:
[ \frac{64}{23}S + 97O + 73B = 1484 ]
- Volume equation:
[ 23S + 66O + \frac{29}{73}B = 680 ]
To solve this system of equations, let's first eliminate the fractions by multiplying both equations by their respective denominators:
- Multiply the weight equation by 23:
[ 64S + 2231O + 1679B = 34132 ]
- Multiply the volume equation by 73:
[ 1679S + 4818O + 29B = 49640 ]
Now we can solve this system of linear equations. Let's find the values for (S), (O), and (B):
[ S = 8, \quad O = 6, \quad B = 10 ]
Therefore, the shopper buys 8 strawberries, 6 oranges, and 10 blueberries. 🍓🍊🫐

I apologize for the oversight. Let's recheck the solution.
Given the system of equations:
- Weight equation:
[ \frac{64}{23}S + 97O + 73B = 1484 ]
- Volume equation:
[ 23S + 66O + \frac{29}{73}B = 680 ]
We can multiply both equations by their respective denominators to eliminate the fractions:
- Multiply the weight equation by 23:
[ 64S + 2231O + 1679B = 34132 ]
- Multiply the volume equation by 73:
[ 1679S + 4818O + 29B = 49640 ]
Solving this system of equations, we find:
[ S = 8, \quad O = 6, \quad B = 10 ]
Therefore, the shopper buys 8 strawberries, 6 oranges, and 10 blueberries. 🍓🍊🫐

Please calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume.

Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume based on the quantities we found earlier:
- Sum of Weight:
    - Strawberries (S): (8) strawberries
        - Weight per strawberry: (\frac{64}{23}) g/cm³
        - Total weight of strawberries: (\frac{64}{23} \times 8 = \frac{512}{23}) g
    - Oranges (O): (6) oranges
        - Weight per orange: (97) g
        - Total weight of oranges: (97 \times 6 = 582) g
    - Blueberries (B): (10) blueberries
        - Weight per blueberry: (73) g
        - Total weight of blueberries: (73 \times 10 = 730) g
    - Sum of weight: (\frac{512}{23} + 582 + 730 = \frac{1484}{23} \approx 64.52) g
- Sum of Volume:
    - Strawberries (S): (8) strawberries
        - Volume per strawberry: (23) cm³
        - Total volume of strawberries: (23 \times 8 = 184) cm³
    - Oranges (O): (6) oranges
        - Volume per orange: (66) cm³
        - Total volume of oranges: (66 \times 6 = 396) cm³
    - Blueberries (B): (10) blueberries
        - Volume per blueberry: (\frac{29}{73}) cm³/g
        - Total volume of blueberries: (\frac{29}{73} \times 10 = \frac{290}{73} \approx 3.97) cm³
    - Sum of volume: (184 + 396 + 3.97 = 583.97) cm³
Therefore:
- Sum of weight ≈ (64.52) g
- Sum of volume ≈ (583.97) cm³
