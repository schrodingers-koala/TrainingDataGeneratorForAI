Let's assume that the shopper buys x blueberries, y grapes, and z melons.
From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:

0.95x + 0.28y + 0.79z = 0.84
48x + 45y + 29z = 135
x + y + z = 3

We can solve this system of equations to get the values of x, y, and z.
Subtracting the third equation from the first equation, we get:

0.95x + 0.28y + 0.79z - x - y - z = 0.84 - 3
=> 0.95x - x + 0.28y - y + 0.79z - z = -2.16
=> 0.95(x - y - z) + 0.28(y - x - z) + 0.79(z - x - y) = -2.16
=> 0.05(x - y - z) - 0.51(x - y - z) + 0.21(z - x - y) = -2.16
=> -0.46(x - y - z) + 0.21(z - x - y) = -2.16
=> 23(x-y-z) - 10(z-x-y) = 408
=> (23-10)x + (-23+21)y + (-23-10)z = 408
=> 13x-2y-33z=408

Multiplying the third equation by 29 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get:

48x + 45y + 29z - (29x + 29y + 29z) = 135 - (3 * 29)
=> 19x + 16y = 24

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:

13x-2y-33z=408    ...(1)
19x+16y=24        ...(2)

Multiplying (2) by `13` and subtracting it from (1), we get:

-210y-400z=312

Dividing by `-10`, we get:

21y+40z=-31.2

Since **y** and **z** are integers, we can try different values of **y** and **z** that satisfy this equation.

Let's try **y=1** and **z=0**.

Substituting these values in equation (2), we get:

19x+16(1)=24
=> x=8/19

This is not an integer value for **x**, so let's try another combination.

Let's try **y=0** and **z=1**.

Substituting these values in equation (2), we get:

19x+16(0)=24
=> x=24/19

This is also not an integer value for **x**, so let's try another combination.

Let's try **y=2** and **z=1**.

Substituting these values in equation (2), we get:

19x+16(2)=24
=> x=-8/19

This is not a valid solution since the number of fruits cannot be negative.

Let's try one more combination.

Let's try **y=1** and **z=1**.

Substituting these values in equation (2), we get:

19x+16(1)=24
=> x=8/19

This is a valid solution since all variables are positive integers.

Therefore, the shopper buys `8` blueberries, `1` grape, and `1` melon.

According to the solution we found earlier, the shopper buys `8` blueberries, `1` grape, and `1` melon. The total price of this purchase can be calculated as follows:


Total price = (Price of 8 blueberries) + (Price of 1 grape) + (Price of 1 melon)
= (8 * 0.95) + (1 * 0.28) + (1 * 0.79)
= 7.6 + 0.28 + 0.79
= 8.67 cents


Therefore, the total price of the shopper's purchase is **8.67 cents**.
