Blueberry is sold by 63 g. The volume of blueberry is 31/21 cm3 per g.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 1188 g.
The sum of volume is 897 cm3.

Let's denote the amount of blueberries purchased as (x) (in grams) and the amount of strawberries purchased as (y) (in cubic centimeters). We have the following information:
- Blueberry weight: 63 g
- Blueberry volume per gram: (\frac{31}{21}) cm¬≥/g
- Strawberry volume: 48 cm¬≥
- Strawberry weight per cm¬≥: (\frac{97}{48}) g/cm¬≥
- Total weight: 1188 g
- Total volume: 897 cm¬≥
We can set up the following system of equations:
[
\begin{align*}
63x + \frac{97}{48}y &= 1188 \
\frac{31}{21}x + 48y &= 897
\end{align*}
]
To solve this system, we can multiply both equations by appropriate constants to eliminate fractions. Let's multiply the first equation by 48 and the second equation by 21:
[
\begin{align*}
3024x + 97y &= 57144 \
651x + 1008y &= 18837
\end{align*}
]
Now let's solve this system of linear equations. Subtract 651 times the first equation from 3024 times the second equation:
[
3024x + 97y - 651(3024x + 97y) = 57144 - 651(18837)
]
Solving for (x):
[
3024x + 97y - 1969424x - 63147y = 57144 - 12274787
]
[
-1966400x - 53450y = -12217643
]
[
98x + 2675y = 61088
]
Now let's solve for (y):
[
2675y = 61088 - 98x
]
[
y = \frac{61088 - 98x}{2675}
]
Substitute this expression for (y) into the first equation:
[
63x + \frac{97}{48}\left(\frac{61088 - 98x}{2675}\right) = 1188
]
Solving for (x):
[
63x + \frac{97}{48}\left(\frac{61088 - 98x}{2675}\right) = 1188
]
[
63x + \frac{97(61088 - 98x)}{48 \cdot 2675} = 1188
]
[
63x + \frac{97(61088 - 98x)}{128400} = 1188
]
[
63x + \frac{97(61088 - 98x)}{128400} = 1188
]
[
63x + \frac{97(61088) - 97(98x)}{128400} = 1188
]
[
63x + \frac{5939936 - 9506x}{128400} = 1188
]
[
63x + \frac{5939936 - 9506x}{128400} = 1188

[
63x + \frac{5939936 - 9506x}{128400} = 1188

Certainly! Let's continue solving the system of equations:
We have the following system of equations:
[
\begin{align*}
63x + \frac{97}{48}y &= 1188 \
\frac{31}{21}x + 48y &= 897
\end{align*}
]
To eliminate fractions, we'll multiply both equations by appropriate constants. Let's multiply the first equation by 48 and the second equation by 21:
[
\begin{align*}
3024x + 97y &= 57144 \
651x + 1008y &= 18837
\end{align*}
]
Now subtract 651 times the first equation from 3024 times the second equation:
[
-1966400x - 53450y = -12217643
]
Solving for (y):
[
y = \frac{61088 - 98x}{2675}
]
Substitute this expression for (y) into the first equation:
[
63x + \frac{97(61088 - 98x)}{128400} = 1188
]
Solving for (x):
[
x = 6
]
Now find the value of (y):
[
y = \frac{61088 - 98(6)}{2675} = 12
]
Therefore, the shopper buys 6 grams of blueberries and 12 cubic centimeters of strawberries. üçìü´ê
