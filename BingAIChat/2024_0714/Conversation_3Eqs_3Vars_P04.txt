Let's find a solution! We have three types of fruits: strawberries, kiwifruits, and blueberries. Let's denote the number of strawberries as (S), kiwifruits as (K), and blueberries as (B).
From the given information:
- The price of strawberries is 87 cents, so the total cost of strawberries is (87S) cents.
- The price of kiwifruits is 58 cents, so the total cost of kiwifruits is (58K) cents.
- The price of blueberries is 73 cents, so the total cost of blueberries is (73B) cents.
- The total cost of all fruits is 1135 cents: (87S + 58K + 73B = 1135).
We also know the total weight of all fruits:
- The weight of strawberries is 54 g, so the total weight of strawberries is (54S) g.
- The weight of kiwifruits is 66 g, so the total weight of kiwifruits is (66K) g.
- The weight of blueberries is 19 g, so the total weight of blueberries is (19B) g.
- The total weight of all fruits is 734 g: (54S + 66K + 19B = 734).
Now let's solve this system of equations to find the values of (S), (K), and (B):
- From the cost equation:
[87S + 58K + 73B = 1135]
- From the weight equation:
[54S + 66K + 19B = 734]
We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. First, let's multiply the cost equation by 2 and the weight equation by 3 to make the coefficients of (S) match:
[174S + 116K + 146B = 2270]
[162S + 198K + 57B = 2202]
Now subtract the second equation from the first:
[12S - 82K + 89B = 68]
Since we want a positive solution, let's try different values for (B). If we set (B = 1), we get:
[12S - 82K + 89 = 68]
[12S - 82K = -21]
The smallest positive integer solution for (S) and (K) that satisfies this equation is (S = 7) and (K = 1). Therefore, the shopper buys 7 strawberries, 1 kiwifruit, and 9 blueberries. üçìü•ùü´ê
