Let's break this down step by step:
- Blueberries:
    - Price: $$\frac{30}{23}$$ cents per gram
    - Weight: 46 grams
    - Total cost for blueberries: $$\frac{30}{23} \times 46 = 60$$ cents
- Grapes:
    - Price: 54 cents each
    - Weight: 54 grams each
    - Let's say the shopper buys "g" grapes.
    - Total cost for grapes: $$54g$$ cents
- Strawberries:
    - Price: $$\frac{2}{9}$$ cents per cm³
    - Volume: 27 cm³
    - Weight of strawberries: $$\frac{58}{27} \times 27 = 58$$ grams
    - Total cost for strawberries: $$\frac{2}{9} \times 27 = 6$$ cents
Now, let's set up the equations based on the given information:
- Total price: $$60 + 54g + 6 = 648$$ cents
- Total weight: $$46 + 54g + 58 = 852$$ grams
- Total volume: $$\frac{91}{46} \times 46 + 98g + 27 = 1185$$ cm³
Solving these equations simultaneously, we find:
- $$g = 6$$ (number of grapes)
- Blueberries: $$46$$ grams
- Grapes: $$6$$ grapes
- Strawberries: $$27$$ cm³
So, the shopper buys 46 grams of blueberries, 6 grapes, and 27 cm³ of strawberries. 🍇🍓🫐  .
