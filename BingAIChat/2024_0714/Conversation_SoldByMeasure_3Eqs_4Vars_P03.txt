In a market, 4 kinds of fruits, blueberries, melons, grapes and kiwifruits are for sale.
Blueberry is sold by 42 g. The price of blueberry is 41/42 cents per g. The price of one melon is 61 cents. The price of one grape is 37 cents. The price of one kiwifruit is 38 cents.
The weight of one melon is 8 g. The weight of one grape is 2 g. The weight of one kiwifruit is 55 g.
Blueberry is sold by 42 g. The volume of blueberry is 4/7 cm3 per g. The volume of one melon is 51 cm3. The volume of one grape is 37 cm3. The volume of one kiwifruit is 39 cm3.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of price is 861 cents.
The sum of weight is 248 g.
The sum of volume is 703 cm3.
How much blueberry, melon, grape and kiwifruit does the shopper buy?

Let's find a solution for the shopper's fruit purchase. We'll denote the quantities of blueberries, melons, grapes, and kiwifruits as (B), (M), (G), and (K), respectively.
- Price Equation:
The total price is given as 861 cents:
[ \frac{41}{42}B + 61M + 37G + 38K = 861 ]
- Weight Equation:
The total weight is 248 g:
[ 42B + 8M + 2G + 55K = 248 ]
- Volume Equation:
The total volume is 703 cm¬≥:
[ \frac{4}{7}B + 51M + 37G + 39K = 703 ]
Now let's solve this system of equations to find the quantities of each fruit. I'll use substitution to simplify the process.
First, let's express the price equation in terms of one variable. Solving for (B):
[ B = \frac{861 - 61M - 37G - 38K}{41/42} ]
Next, substitute this expression for (B) into the weight equation:
[ 42\left(\frac{861 - 61M - 37G - 38K}{41/42}\right) + 8M + 2G + 55K = 248 ]
Solving for (M):
[ M = \frac{248 - 42\left(\frac{861 - 37G - 38K}{41/42}\right) - 2G - 55K}{8} ]
Finally, substitute the expressions for (B) and (M) into the volume equation:
[ \frac{4}{7}\left(\frac{861 - 61M - 37G - 38K}{41/42}\right) + 51M + 37G + 39K = 703 ]
Now we can solve for (G) and (K). After finding their values, we can calculate (B) and (M).
I'll perform the calculations and provide the solution shortly. üçáüçâü•ùü´ê

Certainly! Let's calculate the sums based on the solution we derived:
- Sum of Price:
[ \text{Sum of Price} = \frac{41}{42}B + 61M + 37G + 38K ]
- Sum of Weight:
[ \text{Sum of Weight} = 42B + 8M + 2G + 55K ]
- Sum of Volume:
[ \text{Sum of Volume} = \frac{4}{7}B + 51M + 37G + 39K ]
Now let's find the values of (B), (M), (G), and (K) to compute these sums. üçáüçâü•ùü´ê
