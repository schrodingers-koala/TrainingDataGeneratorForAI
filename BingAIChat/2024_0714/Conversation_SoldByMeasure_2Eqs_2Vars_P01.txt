Let's denote the amount of strawberry bought as (x) and the amount of blueberry bought as (y). We have the following information:
- The weight of strawberry is (\frac{80}{17}) g per cm³.
- The volume of blueberry is (\frac{32}{19}) cm³ per g.
- The sum of weight is 556 g: (80x + 19y = 556).
- The sum of volume is 230 cm³: (17x + 32y = 230).
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (x) and (y). Let's start by solving for (x):
From the second equation, we get:
[17x = 230 - 32y]
[x = \frac{230 - 32y}{17}]
Now substitute this expression for (x) into the first equation:
[80\left(\frac{230 - 32y}{17}\right) + 19y = 556]
To simplify, multiply both sides of the equation by 17:
[80(230 - 32y) + 323y = 556 \cdot 17]
Expand and rearrange:
[18400 - 2560y + 323y = 9452]
[18400 - 2237y = 9452]
[2237y = 8948]
[y = 4]
Now find the value of (x):
[x = \frac{230 - 32y}{17} = \frac{230 - 32 \cdot 4}{17} = 6]
Therefore, the shopper buys 6 g of strawberries and 4 g of blueberries.
