In a market, 3 kinds of fruits, blueberries, apples and strawberries are for sale.
The price of blueberry is 4 cents. The price of apple is 60 cents. The price of strawberry is 28 cents.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The number of fruits is 13.
The sum of price is 316 cents.
How many blueberries, apples and strawberries does the shopper buy?

Let's denote the number of blueberries as (b), the number of apples as (a), and the number of strawberries as (s). We have the following information:
- The total number of fruits is 13:
[ b + a + s = 13 ]
- The total cost is 316 cents:
[ 4b + 60a + 28s = 316 ]
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (b), (a), and (s). Let's proceed:
From the first equation, we can express (s) in terms of (b) and (a):
[ s = 13 - b - a ]
Substitute this expression for (s) into the second equation:
[ 4b + 60a + 28(13 - b - a) = 316 ]
Simplify the equation:
[ 4b + 60a + 364 - 28b - 28a = 316 ]
Combine like terms:
[ 32b + 32a = 316 - 364 ]
[ 32b + 32a = -48 ]
Divide both sides by 32:
[ b + a = -1.5 ]
Since the number of fruits cannot be negative, we'll consider non-negative integer solutions. Let's try different values for (b) and (a):
- If (b = 0), then (a = -1.5), which is not a valid solution.
- If (b = 1), then (a = -2.5), which is also not valid.
- If (b = 2), then (a = -3.5), still not valid.
- If (b = 3), then (a = -4.5), not valid either.
We can see that there are no valid integer solutions for (b) and (a). Therefore, it seems there might be an error in the given information. Please double-check the problem, and let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
