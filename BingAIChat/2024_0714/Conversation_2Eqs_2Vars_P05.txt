Let's denote the number of blueberries as (b) and the number of melons as (m). We have the following information:
- The price of a blueberry is 61 cents, so the total cost of blueberries is (61b) cents.
- The price of a melon is 25 cents, so the total cost of melons is (25m) cents.
- The total number of fruits is 7, so we have the equation: (b + m = 7).
- The sum of the prices is 355 cents, so we have the equation: (61b + 25m = 355).
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (b) and (m). Let's start by solving for (b):
From the first equation, we get:
[ b = 7 - m ]
Substitute this expression for (b) into the second equation:
[ 61(7 - m) + 25m = 355 ]
Solving for (m):
[ 427 - 61m + 25m = 355 ]
[ 427 - 36m = 355 ]
[ 36m = 72 ]
[ m = 2 ]
Now that we know (m), we can find (b):
[ b = 7 - m = 7 - 2 = 5 ]
Therefore, the shopper buys 5 blueberries and 2 melons. üçáüçà
