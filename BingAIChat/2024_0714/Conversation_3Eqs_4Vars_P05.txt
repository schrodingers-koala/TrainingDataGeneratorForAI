Let's solve this step by step. We'll denote the number of apples as (a), grapes as (g), melons as (m), and strawberries as (s).
- Price Equation:
We have the following prices:
    - Apple: 67 cents
    - Grape: 51 cents
    - Melon: 91 cents
    - Strawberry: 36 cents
The total price is 1634 cents:
[ 67a + 51g + 91m + 36s = 1634 \quad \text{(1)} ]
- Weight Equation:
We have the following weights:
    - Apple: 71 g
    - Grape: 6 g
    - Melon: 76 g
    - Strawberry: 66 g
The total weight is 1647 g:
[ 71a + 6g + 76m + 66s = 1647 \quad \text{(2)} ]
- Number of Fruits Equation:
The total number of fruits is 27:
[ a + g + m + s = 27 \quad \text{(3)} ]
Now let's solve this system of equations. I'll calculate the values for each fruit:
- First, let's express (s) in terms of (a):
From equation (3), we have:
[ s = 27 - a - g - m ]
- Next, substitute the expression for (s) into equations (1) and (2):
[ 67a + 51g + 91m + 36(27 - a - g - m) = 1634 ]
[ 71a + 6g + 76m + 66(27 - a - g - m) = 1647 ]
- Simplify the equations:
[ 31a + 15g + 55m = 1018 \quad \text{(4)} ]
[ 5a + 10g + 10m = 177 \quad \text{(5)} ]
- Now, let's solve equations (4) and (5) simultaneously. Subtract 10 times equation (5) from equation (4):
[ 21a + 5g = 841 ]
[ 21a = 841 - 5g ]
[ a = \frac{841 - 5g}{21} ]
- Since (a) must be an integer, let's find a value of (g) that satisfies this condition. We can try different values of (g):
    - For (g = 1), we get (a = 40).
    - For (g = 2), we get (a = 35).
Let's choose (g = 1):
    - (a = 40)
    - (s = 27 - a - g - m = 27 - 40 - 1 - m = 26 - m)
- Now, calculate the number of melons:
[ 76m = 1647 - 71a - 6g - 66s = 1647 - 71(40) - 6(1) - 66(26 - m) ]
[ 76m = 1647 - 2840 - 6 - 66(26 - m) ]
[ 76m = 1647 - 2846 + 4356m ]
[ 4292m = 1647 - 2846 ]
[ m = \frac{1647 - 2846}{4292} = 0 ]
- Since (m = 0), there are no melons. The solution is:
    - Apples: 40
    - Grapes: 1
    - Strawberries: 26
Therefore, the shopper buys 40 apples, 1 grape, and 26 strawberries. No melons are purchased in this solution.    üçéüçáüçì

Please calculate the sum of price and the sum of weight for your answer.

Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of price and the sum of weight for the solution:
- Sum of Price:
    - Apples: 40 apples at 67 cents each = (40 \times 67 = 2680) cents
    - Grapes: 1 grape at 51 cents = 51 cents
    - Strawberries: 26 strawberries at 36 cents each = (26 \times 36 = 936) cents
Total price = (2680 + 51 + 936 = 3667) cents
- Sum of Weight:
    - Apples: 40 apples at 71 g each = (40 \times 71 = 2840) g
    - Grapes: 1 grape at 6 g = 6 g
    - Strawberries: 26 strawberries at 66 g each = (26 \times 66 = 1716) g
Total weight = (2840 + 6 + 1716 = 4562) g
Therefore, the shopper buys fruits with a total price of 3667 cents and a total weight of 4562 grams. üçéüçáüçì
