Let's denote the number of kiwifruits as (k) and the number of grapes as (g). We have the following information:
- The price of a kiwifruit is 34 cents, so the total cost of kiwifruits is (34k) cents.
- The price of a grape is 36 cents, so the total cost of grapes is (36g) cents.
- The total number of fruits bought is 4, so we have (k + g = 4).
- The sum of the prices is 144 cents, so we have (34k + 36g = 144).
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (k) and (g):
First, let's express (k) in terms of (g):
[ k = 4 - g ]
Now substitute this expression for (k) into the second equation:
[ 34(4 - g) + 36g = 144 ]
Solving for (g):
[ 136 - 34g + 36g = 144 ]
[ 2g = 8 ]
[ g = 4 ]
Now find the value of (k):
[ k = 4 - g = 4 - 4 = 0 ]
Therefore, the shopper buys 0 kiwifruits and 4 grapes. üçá
