Let's denote the number of melons as (m) and the number of blueberries as (b). We have the following information:
- The price of a melon is 29 cents: (29m).
- The price of a blueberry is 92 cents: (92b).
- The total number of fruits bought is 3: (m + b = 3).
- The total cost is 150 cents: (29m + 92b = 150).
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (m) and (b). First, let's express (m) in terms of (b):
[m = 3 - b]
Substitute this into the second equation:
[29(3 - b) + 92b = 150]
Solving for (b):
[87 - 29b + 92b = 150]
[63b = 63]
[b = 1]
Now we can find the value of (m):
[m = 3 - b = 3 - 1 = 2]
Therefore, the shopper buys 2 melons and 1 blueberry. üçâü´ê
