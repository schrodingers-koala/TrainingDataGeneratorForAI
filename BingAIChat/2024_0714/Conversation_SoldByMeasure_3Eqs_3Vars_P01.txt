Let's find the quantities of melon, strawberry, and blueberry that the shopper buys. We'll denote the number of melons as $$m$$, strawberries as $$s$$, and blueberries as $$b$$.
Given the information:
- The price of one melon is 13 cents, so the total cost of melons is $$13m$$ cents.
- Strawberry is sold by 96 cm¬≥, and the price is 1/1 cent per cm¬≥. So the total cost of strawberries is $$\frac{1}{1} \cdot 96s = 96s$$ cents.
- Blueberry is sold by 65 g, and the price is 67/65 cents per g. So the total cost of blueberries is $$\frac{67}{65} \cdot 65b = 67b$$ cents.
- The weight of one melon is 59 g, so the total weight of melons is $$59m$$ g.
- The weight of strawberry is 7/8 g per cm¬≥. So the total weight of strawberries is $$\frac{7}{8} \cdot 96s = 84s$$ g.
- The volume of one melon is 73 cm¬≥, and the volume of blueberry is 86/65 cm¬≥ per g. So the total volume of blueberries is $$\frac{86}{65} \cdot 65b = 86b$$ cm¬≥.
We have the following equations based on the given sums:
- Total cost: $$13m + 96s + 67b = 732$$
- Total weight: $$59m + 84s + 0b = 720$$
- Total volume: $$73m + 0s + 86b = 887$$
Let's solve this system of equations to find the values of $$m$$, $$s$$, and $$b$$.
First, let's express the second equation in terms of $$m$$:
$$59m + 84s = 720$$
Solving for $$s$$:
$$84s = 720 - 59m$$
$$s = \frac{720 - 59m}{84}$$
Now let's express the third equation in terms of $$m$$:
$$73m + 86b = 887$$
Solving for $$b$$:
$$86b = 887 - 73m$$
$$b = \frac{887 - 73m}{86}$$
Substitute the expressions for $$s$$ and $$b$$ into the first equation:
$$13m + 96\left(\frac{720 - 59m}{84}\right) + 67\left(\frac{887 - 73m}{86}\right) = 732$$
To avoid fractions, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 84 (the least common multiple of the denominators):
$$1092m + 96(720 - 59m) + 67(887 - 73m) = 732 \cdot 84$$
Now solve for $$m$$:
$$1092m + 69120 - 5664m + 59429 - 4981m = 61368$$
$$-35m = -6721$$
$$m = 192$$
Now find the values of $$s$$ and $$b$$:
$$s = \frac{720 - 59m}{84} = \frac{720 - 59 \cdot 192}{84} = 6$$
$$b = \frac{887 - 73m}{86} = \frac{887 - 73 \cdot 192}{86} = 9$$
Therefore, the shopper buys 192 melons, 6 strawberries, and 9 blueberries. üçâüçìü´ê

Please calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume for your solution.

Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume based on the solution we found:
- Sum of Weight:
    - Melon weight: $$59m = 59 \cdot 192 = 11328$$ g
    - Strawberry weight: $$84s = 84 \cdot 6 = 504$$ g
    - Blueberry weight: $$0b = 0 \cdot 9 = 0$$ g
    - Total weight: $$11328 + 504 + 0 = 11832$$ g
- Sum of Volume:
    - Melon volume: $$73m = 73 \cdot 192 = 14016$$ cm¬≥
    - Strawberry volume: $$0s = 0 \cdot 6 = 0$$ cm¬≥
    - Blueberry volume: $$86b = 86 \cdot 9 = 774$$ cm¬≥
    - Total volume: $$14016 + 0 + 774 = 14790$$ cm¬≥
Therefore:
- Sum of weight: 11832 g
- Sum of volume: 14790 cm¬≥ üçâüçìü´ê
