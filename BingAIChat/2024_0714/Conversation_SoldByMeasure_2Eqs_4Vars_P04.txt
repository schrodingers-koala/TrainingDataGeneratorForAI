In a market, 4 kinds of fruits, blueberries, apples, kiwifruits and melons are for sale.
The weight of one apple is 60 g. The weight of one kiwifruit is 84 g. The weight of one melon is 69 g.
Blueberry is sold by 17 g. The volume of blueberry is 41/17 cm3 per g. The volume of one apple is 19 cm3. The volume of one kiwifruit is 52 cm3. The volume of one melon is 20 cm3.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 1113 g.
The sum of volume is 608 cm3.

Let's find a solution for the shopper's fruit purchase. We'll denote the quantities of blueberries, apples, kiwifruits, and melons as (B), (A), (K), and (M), respectively.
Given information:
- Weight of one apple ((A)): 60 g
- Weight of one kiwifruit ((K)): 84 g
- Weight of one melon ((M)): 69 g
- Blueberries are sold by 17 g, and their volume is (\frac{{41}}{{17}}) cm¬≥ per gram.
- Volume of one apple: 19 cm¬≥
- Volume of one kiwifruit: 52 cm¬≥
- Volume of one melon: 20 cm¬≥
- Total weight: 1113 g
- Total volume: 608 cm¬≥
We can set up the following equations:
- Weight equation: (60A + 84K + 69M + 17B = 1113)
- Volume equation: (19A + 52K + 20M + \frac{{41}}{{17}}B = 608)
Let's solve this system of equations to find the quantities of each fruit. I'll use substitution to find one solution.
First, let's express (B) in terms of the other variables using the weight equation:
[ B = \frac{{1113 - 60A - 84K - 69M}}{{17}} ]
Now substitute this expression for (B) into the volume equation:
[ 19A + 52K + 20M + \frac{{41}}{{17}}\left(\frac{{1113 - 60A - 84K - 69M}}{{17}}\right) = 608 ]
Solving this equation will give us the values of (A), (K), and (M). Let's proceed with the calculations. üçéü•ùüçâü´ê
Solution:
- Solve for (A):
[ 19A + 52K + 20M + \frac{{41}}{{17}}\left(\frac{{1113 - 60A - 84K - 69M}}{{17}}\right) = 608 ]
Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
[ 19A + 52K + 20M + \frac{{41}}{{17}}\left(\frac{{1113}}{{17}} - \frac{{60A}}{{17}} - \frac{{84K}}{{17}} - \frac{{69M}}{{17}}\right) = 608 ]
[ 19A + 52K + 20M + \frac{{41}}{{17}}\left(\frac{{1113}}{{17}} - \frac{{60A + 84K + 69M}}{{17}}\right) = 608 ]
[ 19A + 52K + 20M + \frac{{41}}{{17}}\left(\frac{{1113}}{{17}} - \frac{{1113 - 60A - 84K - 69M}}{{17}}\right) = 608 ]
[ 19A + 52K + 20M + \frac{{41}}{{17}}\left(\frac{{60A + 84K + 69M}}{{17}}\right) = 608 ]
[ 19A + 52K + 20M + 41\left(\frac{{60A + 84K + 69M}}{{17}}\right) = 608 ]
Multiply both sides by 17 to eliminate fractions:
[ 323A + 884K + 340M + 2460A + 3444K + 2829M = 10336 ]
Combine like terms:
[ 2783A + 4328K + 3169M = 10336 ]
- Solve for (K):
[ 323A + 884K + 340M + 2460A + 3444K + 2829M = 10336 ]
[ 2783A + 4328K + 3169M = 10336 ]
Rearrange the equation:
[ 884K + 3444K = 10336 - 2783A - 3169M ]
[ 4328K = 10336 - 2783A - 3169M ]
[ K = \frac{{10336 - 2783A - 3169M}}{{4328}} ]
- Solve for (M):
[ M = \frac{{1113 - 60A - 84K - 69M}}{{

Please calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume for your solution.

Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume for the solution we derived earlier.
- Sum of Weight:
We found the following expressions for the quantities of each fruit:
    - Blueberries ((B)): $$B = \frac{{1113 - 60A - 84K - 69M}}{{17}}$$
    - Apples ((A)): $$A$$ (from the weight equation)
    - Kiwifruits ((K)): $$K = \frac{{10336 - 2783A - 3169M}}{{4328}}$$
    - Melons ((M)): $$M = \frac{{1113 - 60A - 84K - 69M}}{{17}}$$
The sum of weight is:
[ \text{Sum of Weight} = 60A + 84K + 69M + 17B ]
- Sum of Volume:
We know the volume of each fruit:
    - Volume of one apple: 19 cm¬≥
    - Volume of one kiwifruit: 52 cm¬≥
    - Volume of one melon: 20 cm¬≥
    - Volume of blueberries per gram: $$\frac{{41}}{{17}}$$ cm¬≥/g
The sum of volume is:
[ \text{Sum of Volume} = 19A + 52K + 20M + \frac{{41}}{{17}}B ]
Let's compute these values! üçéü•ùüçâü´ê
