Let's denote the number of apples as (a) and the number of melons as (m). We have the following information:
- The price of an apple is 80 cents, so the total cost of apples is (80a) cents.
- The price of a melon is 78 cents, so the total cost of melons is (78m) cents.
- The total number of fruits is 10, so (a + m = 10).
- The sum of the prices is 790 cents, so (80a + 78m = 790).
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (a) and (m). Let's start by solving for (a):
From equation (3), we have:
[ a = 10 - m ]
Substitute this expression for (a) into equation (4):
[ 80(10 - m) + 78m = 790 ]
Solving for (m):
[ 800 - 80m + 78m = 790 ]
[ -2m = -10 ]
[ m = 5 ]
Now that we know (m), we can find (a):
[ a = 10 - m = 10 - 5 = 5 ]
Therefore, the shopper buys 5 apples and 5 melons. üçéüçà
