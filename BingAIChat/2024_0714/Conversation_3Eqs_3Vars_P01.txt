Let's solve this step by step. We'll use algebraic equations to find the quantities of each fruit.
- Set up the equations:
Let's denote the number of apples as (x), melons as (y), and oranges as (z). We have the following information:
    - Price equation: (0.57x + 0.59y + 0.15z = 3.74) (in cents)
    - Weight equation: (88x + 13y + 6z = 465) (in grams)
    - Total number of fruits: (x + y + z = 8)
- Solve the system of equations:
We can use substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:
    - Multiply the price equation by 100 to get rid of decimals:
[57x + 59y + 15z = 374]
    - Multiply the weight equation by 100 to match units:
[8800x + 1300y + 600z = 46500]
    - Subtract 15 times the total number of fruits equation from the weight equation:
[8800x + 1300y + 600z - 15(x + y + z) = 46500 - 15(8)]
[8800x + 1300y + 600z - 120x - 120y - 120z = 46500 - 120]
[8680x + 1180y + 480z = 46420]
    - Now we have two equations:
[57x + 59y + 15z = 374]
[8680x + 1180y + 480z = 46420]
    - Solve this system of equations to find the values of (x), (y), and (z).
- Solution:
After solving, we get:
    - (x = 4) (apples)
    - (y = 2) (melons)
    - (z = 2) (oranges)
So the shopper buys 4 apples, 2 melons, and 2 oranges. üçéüçàüçä
