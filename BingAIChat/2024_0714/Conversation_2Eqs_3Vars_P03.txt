Let's denote the number of grapes as (g), kiwifruits as (k), and apples as (a). We have the following information:
- The price of grapes is 30 cents, so the total cost of grapes is (30g) cents.
- The price of kiwifruits is 51 cents, so the total cost of kiwifruits is (51k) cents.
- The price of apples is 28 cents, so the total cost of apples is (28a) cents.
- The total number of fruits is 8, so we have the equation: (g + k + a = 8).
- The sum of the prices is 345 cents, so we have the equation: (30g + 51k + 28a = 345).
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (g), (k), and (a). Let's proceed:
From the first equation, we can express (a) in terms of (g) and (k):
[ a = 8 - g - k ]
Substitute this expression for (a) into the second equation:
[ 30g + 51k + 28(8 - g - k) = 345 ]
Solving for (k):
[ 30g + 51k + 224 - 28g - 28k = 345 ]
[ 23k = 121 ]
[ k = 5 ]
Now, find the value of (g):
[ g + 5 + a = 8 ]
[ g + a = 3 ]
[ g + (8 - g - 5) = 3 ]
[ g = 2 ]
Finally, calculate the value of (a):
[ a = 8 - g - k = 8 - 2 - 5 = 1 ]
Therefore, the shopper buys 2 grapes, 5 kiwifruits, and 1 apple. üçáü•ùüçé
