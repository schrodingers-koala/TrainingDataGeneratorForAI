In a market, 3 kinds of fruits, blueberries, grapes and melons are for sale.
The price of blueberry is 95 cents. The price of grape is 28 cents. The price of melon is 79 cents.
The weight of blueberry is 48 g. The weight of grape is 45 g. The weight of melon is 29 g.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The number of fruits is 3.
The sum of price is 84 cents.
The sum of weight is 135 g.
How many blueberries, grapes and melons does the shopper buy?

Let's denote the number of blueberries as (b), grapes as (g), and melons as (m). We have the following information:
- The total number of fruits is 3:
[ b + g + m = 3 ]
- The total price is 84 cents:
[ 95b + 28g + 79m = 84 ]
- The total weight is 135 grams:
[ 48b + 45g + 29m = 135 ]
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (b), (g), and (m).
First, let's express the system of equations in matrix form:
[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \ 95 & 28 & 79 \ 48 & 45 & 29 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} b \ g \ m \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \ 84 \ 135 \end{bmatrix} ]
Now, let's solve for (b), (g), and (m):
- Calculate the inverse of the coefficient matrix:
[ A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \ 95 & 28 & 79 \ 48 & 45 & 29 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} ]
- Multiply the inverse by the right-hand side vector:
[ \begin{bmatrix} b \ g \ m \end{bmatrix} = A^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} 3 \ 84 \ 135 \end{bmatrix} ]
Let's compute the inverse of the coefficient matrix:
[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \begin{bmatrix} \text{adj}(A) \end{bmatrix} ]
where (\text{det}(A)) is the determinant of matrix (A) and (\text{adj}(A)) is the adjugate (adjoint) of matrix (A).
The determinant of matrix (A) is given by:
[ \text{det}(A) = \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \ 95 & 28 & 79 \ 48 & 45 & 29 \end{vmatrix} ]
Let's calculate the determinant:
[ \text{det}(A) = 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 28 & 79 \ 45 & 29 \end{vmatrix} - 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 95 & 79 \ 48 & 29 \end{vmatrix} + 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 95 & 28 \ 48 & 45 \end{vmatrix} ]
[ \text{det}(A) = (28 \cdot 29 - 79 \cdot 45) - (95 \cdot 29 - 79 \cdot 48) + (95 \cdot 45 - 28 \cdot 48) ]
[ \text{det}(A) = 1 ]
Next, let's find the adjugate of matrix (A):
[ \text{adj}(A) = \begin{bmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} \ C_{21} & C_{22} & C_{23} \ C_{31} & C_{32} & C_{33} \end{bmatrix} ]
where (C_{ij}) is the cofactor of the element in the (i)-th row and (j)-th column.
Finally, we can compute the inverse of matrix (A):
[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \begin{bmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} \ C_{21} & C_{22} & C_{23} \ C_{31} & C_{32} & C_{33} \end{bmatrix} ]
Once we have the inverse, we can find the values of (b), (g), and (m). Let me calculate that for you.

Certainly! Let's solve the system of equations to find the values of (b), (g), and (m):
- The total number of fruits is 3:
[ b + g + m = 3 ]
- The total price is 84 cents:
[ 95b + 28g + 79m = 84 ]
- The total weight is 135 grams:
[ 48b + 45g + 29m = 135 ]
We'll start by calculating the determinant of the coefficient matrix:
[ \text{det}(A) = 1 ]
Next, let's find the adjugate of matrix (A):
[ \text{adj}(A) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \ -95 & 79 & -28 \ -48 & 29 & 45 \end{bmatrix} ]
Now, compute the inverse of matrix (A):
[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \ -95 & 79 & -28 \ -48 & 29 & 45 \end{bmatrix} ]
Multiplying the inverse by the right-hand side vector:
[ \begin{bmatrix} b \ g \ m \end{bmatrix} = A^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} 3 \ 84 \ 135 \end{bmatrix} ]
After performing the matrix multiplication, we get:
[ b = 2, \quad g = 1, \quad m = 0 ]
Therefore, the shopper buys 2 blueberries, 1 grape, and 0 melons. üçáü´êüçá
