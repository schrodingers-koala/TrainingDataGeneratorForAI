In a market, 4 kinds of fruits, kiwifruits, grapes, apples and strawberries are for sale.
The weight of one kiwifruit is 24 g. The weight of one grape is 26 g. The weight of one apple is 22 g. Strawberry is sold by 15 cm3. The weight of strawberry is 24/5 g per cm3.
The volume of one kiwifruit is 97 cm3. The volume of one grape is 22 cm3. The volume of one apple is 21 cm3.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 366 g.
The sum of volume is 316 cm3.
How much kiwifruit, grape, apple and strawberry does the shopper buy?

Let's find a solution! We have the following information:
- Weight of one kiwifruit: 24 g
- Weight of one grape: 26 g
- Weight of one apple: 22 g
- Strawberry is sold by volume: 15 cm¬≥
- Weight of strawberry per cm¬≥: 24/5 g
We also know the total weight is 366 g and the total volume is 316 cm¬≥.
Let's denote the number of kiwifruits as (x), grapes as (y), apples as (z), and strawberries as (w).
We can set up the following equations:
- Weight equation: (24x + 26y + 22z + \frac{24}{5}w = 366)
- Volume equation: (97x + 22y + 21z + 15w = 316)
Now let's solve this system of equations. I'll use substitution to find the values of (x), (y), (z), and (w). First, let's solve for (w) in terms of the other variables using the volume equation:
[w = \frac{316 - 97x - 22y - 21z}{15}]
Next, substitute this expression for (w) into the weight equation:
[24x + 26y + 22z + \frac{24}{5}\left(\frac{316 - 97x - 22y - 21z}{15}\right) = 366]
To simplify, multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to get rid of the fractions:
[360x + 390y + 330z + 24(316 - 97x - 22y - 21z) = 5490]
Now distribute the 24:
[360x + 390y + 330z + 7584 - 2328x - 528y - 504z = 5490]
Combine like terms:
[32x + 138y - 174z = -1094]
Now let's express (x) in terms of (y) and (z):
[x = \frac{1094 - 138y + 174z}{32}]
We can use this expression for (x) to find the values of (y) and (z). Since we want a whole number solution, let's check integer values for (y) and (z). I'll start with (y = 1) and (z = 1):
[x = \frac{1094 - 138(1) + 174(1)}{32} = 30]
Now let's calculate the corresponding weight for each fruit:
- Kiwifruit weight: (24x = 24 \cdot 30 = 720) g
- Grape weight: (26y = 26 \cdot 1 = 26) g
- Apple weight: (22z = 22 \cdot 1 = 22) g
- Strawberry weight: (\frac{24}{5}w = \frac{24}{5} \cdot 30 = 144) g
The shopper buys 30 kiwifruits, 1 grape, 1 apple, and 30 cm¬≥ of strawberries. üçéüçáü•ùüçì
Please note that there may be other valid solutions, but this is one possible combination.

Please calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume for your solution.

Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of weight and the sum of volume for the solution we found:
- Sum of Weight:
    - Kiwifruit weight: (24 \times 30 = 720) g
    - Grape weight: (26 \times 1 = 26) g
    - Apple weight: (22 \times 1 = 22) g
    - Strawberry weight: (\frac{24}{5} \times 30 = 144) g
    - Total weight: (720 + 26 + 22 + 144 = 912) g
- Sum of Volume:
    - Kiwifruit volume: (97 \times 30 = 2910) cm¬≥
    - Grape volume: (22 \times 1 = 22) cm¬≥
    - Apple volume: (21 \times 1 = 21) cm¬≥
    - Strawberry volume: (30) cm¬≥
    - Total volume: (2910 + 22 + 21 + 30 = 2983) cm¬≥
Therefore, the shopper buys a total weight of 912 g and a total volume of 2983 cm¬≥. üçéüçáü•ùüçì
