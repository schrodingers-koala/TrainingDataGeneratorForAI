In a market, 3 kinds of fruits, apples, grapes and strawberries are for sale.
The price of apple is 62 cents. The price of grape is 26 cents. The price of strawberry is 72 cents.
The weight of apple is 1 g. The weight of grape is 46 g. The weight of strawberry is 73 g.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The number of fruits is 15.
The sum of price is 908 cents.
The sum of weight is 465 g.

Let's find the solution step by step. We'll denote the number of apples as (a), grapes as (g), and strawberries as (s).
- Price Equation:
The total price is given as 908 cents. We can express this as:
[62a + 26g + 72s = 908]
- Weight Equation:
The total weight is given as 465 grams. We can express this as:
[a + 46g + 73s = 465]
- Number of Fruits Equation:
The total number of fruits is 15. We can express this as:
[a + g + s = 15]
Now let's solve this system of equations. I'll use substitution to find the values of (a), (g), and (s).
First, let's solve for (a) in terms of (g) and (s) using the third equation:
[a = 15 - g - s]
Next, substitute this expression for (a) into the first two equations:
[62(15 - g - s) + 26g + 72s = 908]
[15g + 10s = 246]
And:
[15 - g - s + 46g + 73s = 465]
[31g + 72s = 450]
Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
- (15g + 10s = 246)
- (31g + 72s = 450)
Solving this system, we find:
(g = 6) and (s = 3)
Finally, calculate the value of (a):
[a = 15 - g - s = 15 - 6 - 3 = 6]
Therefore, the shopper buys 6 apples, 6 grapes, and 3 strawberries. üçéüçáüçì

Please calculate the sum of price and the sum of weight for your answer.

Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of price and the sum of weight for the solution we found:
- Sum of Price:
    - Apples: (6) apples at (62) cents each = (6 \times 62 = 372) cents
    - Grapes: (6) grapes at (26) cents each = (6 \times 26 = 156) cents
    - Strawberries: (3) strawberries at (72) cents each = (3 \times 72 = 216) cents
    - Total price = (372 + 156 + 216 = 744) cents
- Sum of Weight:
    - Apples: (6) apples, each weighing (1) gram = (6) grams
    - Grapes: (6) grapes, each weighing (46) grams = (276) grams
    - Strawberries: (3) strawberries, each weighing (73) grams = (219) grams
    - Total weight = (6 + 276 + 219 = 501) grams
Therefore:
- Sum of price = (744) cents
- Sum of weight = (501) grams üçéüçáüçì
