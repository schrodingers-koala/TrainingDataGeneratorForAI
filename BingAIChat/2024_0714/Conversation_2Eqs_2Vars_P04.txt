Let's denote the number of blueberries as (b) and the number of kiwifruits as (k). We have the following information:
- The price of a blueberry is 40 cents, so the total cost of blueberries is (40b) cents.
- The price of a kiwifruit is 79 cents, so the total cost of kiwifruits is (79k) cents.
- The total number of fruits is 14, so we have the equation: (b + k = 14).
- The sum of the prices is 911 cents, so we have the equation: (40b + 79k = 911).
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of (b) and (k). Let's start by solving for (b):
From the first equation, we get:
[ b = 14 - k ]
Substitute this expression for (b) into the second equation:
[ 40(14 - k) + 79k = 911 ]
Solving for (k):
[ 560 - 40k + 79k = 911 ]
[ 39k = 351 ]
[ k = 9 ]
Now that we know (k), we can find (b):
[ b = 14 - 9 = 5 ]
Therefore, the shopper buys 5 blueberries and 9 kiwifruits. üçáü•ù
