In a market, 3 kinds of fruits, kiwifruits, oranges and blueberries are for sale.
The price of kiwifruit is 56 cents. The price of orange is 44 cents. The price of blueberry is 40 cents.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The number of fruits is 5.
The sum of price is 240 cents.
How many kiwifruits, oranges and blueberries does the shopper buy?

Certainly! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll denote the number of kiwifruits as $$k$$, oranges as $$o$$, and blueberries as $$b$$.
- We know that the total number of fruits is 5:
$$k + o + b = 5$$
- The total cost is 240 cents:
$$56k + 44o + 40b = 240$$
- We can use the first equation to express one of the variables in terms of the others. Let's solve for $$k$$:
$$k = 5 - o - b$$
- Now substitute the expression for $$k$$ into the second equation:
$$56(5 - o - b) + 44o + 40b = 240$$
- Distribute the coefficients:
$$280 - 56o - 56b + 44o + 40b = 240$$
- Combine like terms:
$$280 - 12o - 16b = 240$$
- Rearrange the equation:
$$12o + 16b = 40$$
- Divide both sides by 4:
$$3o + 4b = 10$$
- Now let's find integer solutions for $$o$$ and $$b$$ that satisfy this equation. One possible solution is:
    - $$o = 2$$
    - $$b = 1$$
- Finally, calculate the number of kiwifruits:
$$k = 5 - o - b = 5 - 2 - 1 = 2$$
Therefore, the shopper buys 2 kiwifruits, 2 oranges, and 1 blueberry. ü•ùüçäü´ê
