In a market, 3 kinds of fruits, oranges, apples and strawberries are for sale.
The price of orange is 42 cents. The price of apple is 50 cents. The price of strawberry is 55 cents.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The number of fruits is 14.
The sum of price is 652 cents.

Let's denote the number of oranges, apples, and strawberries bought by the shopper as (o), (a), and (s), respectively. We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:
- The total number of fruits bought is 14:
[ o + a + s = 14 ]
- The total cost of the fruits is 652 cents:
[ 42o + 50a + 55s = 652 ]
Now let's solve this system of equations. We'll use the elimination method.
First, let's multiply the first equation by 42 to make the coefficients of (o) match:
[ 42(o + a + s) = 42 \cdot 14 ]
[ 42o + 42a + 42s = 588 ]
Next, subtract the second equation from this modified first equation:
[ (42o + 42a + 42s) - (42o + 50a + 55s) = 588 - 652 ]
[ -8a - 13s = -64 ]
Now let's multiply the first equation by 50 to make the coefficients of (a) match:
[ 50(o + a + s) = 50 \cdot 14 ]
[ 50o + 50a + 50s = 700 ]
Add the third equation to this modified first equation:
[ (50o + 50a + 50s) + (50o + 55s) = 700 + 55s ]
[ 100o + 105s = 700 + 55s ]
[ 100o = 700 ]
[ o = 7 ]
Now we can find the values of (a) and (s):
[ -8a - 13s = -64 ]
[ -8a = -64 + 13s ]
[ a = 8 - \frac{13}{8}s ]
Since the number of fruits is a whole number, let's check possible values for (s). We find that when (s = 2), (a = 1) (which is a whole number).
Therefore, the solution is:
- Oranges: 7
- Apples: 1
- Strawberries: 2
The shopper buys 7 oranges, 1 apple, and 2 strawberries.
