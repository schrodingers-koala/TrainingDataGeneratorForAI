Let's solve this fruity puzzle! üçéü•ùüçá
We have four types of fruits: blueberries, kiwifruits, apples, and melons. Let's denote the number of blueberries as (b), kiwifruits as (k), apples as (a), and melons as (m).
Given the information:
- Price of blueberry: 85 cents
- Price of kiwifruit: 88 cents
- Price of apple: 82 cents
- Price of melon: 25 cents
- Weight of blueberry: 18 g
- Weight of kiwifruit: 93 g
- Weight of apple: 18 g
- Weight of melon: 11 g
- Total number of fruits: 11
- Total price: 647 cents
- Total weight: 463 g
We can set up the following system of equations:
- Total price equation:
[ 85b + 88k + 82a + 25m = 647 ]
- Total weight equation:
[ 18b + 93k + 18a + 11m = 463 ]
Now let's solve for the values of (b), (k), (a), and (m). We'll find one solution that satisfies both equations. Shall we proceed? üòä

Certainly! Let's solve the system of equations for the number of each fruit:
- Total price equation:
[ 85b + 88k + 82a + 25m = 647 ]
- Total weight equation:
[ 18b + 93k + 18a + 11m = 463 ]
To find a solution, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's start by solving for one of the variables. I'll use the elimination method.
First, let's express the price equation in terms of one variable. Solving for (b):
[ 85b = 647 - 88k - 82a - 25m ]
[ b = \frac{647 - 88k - 82a - 25m}{85} ]
Next, let's express the weight equation in terms of the same variable. Solving for (b):
[ 18b = 463 - 93k - 18a - 11m ]
[ b = \frac{463 - 93k - 18a - 11m}{18} ]
Since both expressions equal (b), we can set them equal to each other:
[ \frac{647 - 88k - 82a - 25m}{85} = \frac{463 - 93k - 18a - 11m}{18} ]
Now we can cross-multiply and solve for the other variables. Let's find the values of (k), (a), and (m). üòä

Certainly! Let's solve for the exact numbers of each fruit. We'll continue from where we left off.
We have the system of equations:
- Total price equation:
[ 85b + 88k + 82a + 25m = 647 ]
- Total weight equation:
[ 18b + 93k + 18a + 11m = 463 ]
Using the expressions for (b) we derived earlier, we can set them equal to each other:
[ \frac{647 - 88k - 82a - 25m}{85} = \frac{463 - 93k - 18a - 11m}{18} ]
Cross-multiplying and simplifying:
[ 85(463 - 93k - 18a - 11m) = 18(647 - 88k - 82a - 25m) ]
Expanding both sides:
[ 39355 - 7655k - 1470a - 935m = 11646 - 1584k - 1476a - 450m ]
Rearranging terms:
[ 7655k + 1470a + 935m = 11646 - 39355 + 1584k + 1476a + 450m ]
[ 6071k + 24a + 485m = 12345 ]
Now let's find integer solutions for (k), (a), and (m). One possible solution is:
- (k = 1)
- (a = 2)
- (m = 3)
Therefore, the shopper buys:
- 1 blueberry
- 2 kiwifruits
- 2 apples
- 3 melons

Please calculate the sum of price and the sum of weight for your answer.
## Copilot
Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of price and the sum of weight for the shopper's purchase:
- Sum of Price:
Blueberry price: 85 cents √ó 1 = 85 cents
Kiwifruit price: 88 cents √ó 2 = 176 cents
Apple price: 82 cents √ó 2 = 164 cents
Melon price: 25 cents √ó 3 = 75 cents
Total price = 85 + 176 + 164 + 75 = 500 cents
- Sum of Weight:
Blueberry weight: 18 g √ó 1 = 18 g
Kiwifruit weight: 93 g √ó 2 = 186 g
Apple weight: 18 g √ó 2 = 36 g
Melon weight: 11 g √ó 3 = 33 g
Total weight = 18 + 186 + 36 + 33 = 273 g
Therefore, the shopper's purchase has a total price of 500 cents and a total weight of 273 grams. üçéü•ùüçá
