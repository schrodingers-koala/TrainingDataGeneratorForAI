In a market, 4 kinds of fruits, blueberries, apples, kiwifruits and strawberries are for sale.
The weight of one apple is 76 g. The weight of one kiwifruit is 80 g. Strawberry is sold by 10 cm3. The weight of strawberry is 7/10 g per cm3.
Blueberry is sold by 98 g. The volume of blueberry is 97/98 cm3 per g. The volume of one apple is 28 cm3. The volume of one kiwifruit is 78 cm3.
A shopper buys fruits at this market.
The sum of weight is 441 g.
The sum of volume is 309 cm3.

Let's find out how much of each fruit the shopper buys. We'll denote the quantities as follows:
- Let (x) represent the weight of blueberries (in grams).
- Let (y) represent the weight of apples (in grams).
- Let (z) represent the weight of kiwifruits (in grams).
- Let (w) represent the weight of strawberries (in grams).
We have the following information:
- The sum of weights is 441 g:
[x + y + z + w = 441]
- The sum of volumes is 309 cm³:
[97x + 28y + 78z + 10w = 309]
Now let's solve this system of equations to find the values of (x), (y), (z), and (w). We'll use the substitution method.
First, let's express (w) in terms of the other variables from the first equation:
[w = 441 - x - y - z]
Substitute this expression for (w) into the second equation:
[97x + 28y + 78z + 10(441 - x - y - z) = 309]
Simplify the equation:
[97x + 28y + 78z + 4410 - 10x - 10y - 10z = 309]
Combine like terms:
[87x + 18y + 68z = 309 - 4410]
[87x + 18y + 68z = -4101]
Now let's express (y) in terms of (x) and (z):
[y = \frac{-87x - 68z + 4101}{18}]
Substitute this expression for (y) back into the first equation:
[x + \frac{-87x - 68z + 4101}{18} + z + 441 = 441]
Multiply both sides of the equation by 18 to eliminate fractions:
[18x - 87x - 68z + 4101 + 18z + 7938 = 7938]
Combine like terms:
[-69x + 50z = 0]
[69x = 50z]
[x = \frac{50}{69}z]
Since the weights are positive, we'll find integer solutions. Let's try some values for (z):
- If (z = 69), then (x = 50).
- If (z = 138), then (x = 100).
Let's choose the second solution:
- Blueberries ((x)): 100 g
- Apples ((y)): We can find (y) using the expression we derived earlier:
[y = \frac{-87x - 68z + 4101}{18}]
Substituting (x = 100) and (z = 138):
[y = \frac{-8700 - 9384 + 4101}{18} = 117]
- Kiwifruits ((z)): 138 g
- Strawberries ((w)): We can find (w) using the first equation:
[w = 441 - x - y - z = 441 - 100 - 117 - 138 = 86]
Therefore, the shopper buys:
- Blueberries: 100 g
- Apples: 117 g
- Kiwifruits: 138 g
- Strawberries: 86 g   . 🍎🥝🍓🫐
## User
Please calculate the sum of weights and the sum of volumes for your solution.

Certainly! Let's calculate the sum of weights and the sum of volumes for the solution:
- Sum of Weights:
    - Blueberries: 100 g
    - Apples: 117 g
    - Kiwifruits: 138 g
    - Strawberries: 86 g
Total weight = 100 g + 117 g + 138 g + 86 g = 441 g
- Sum of Volumes:
    - Blueberries: We know the volume of blueberries per gram is 97/98 cm³.
Volume of blueberries = 100 g × (97/98 cm³ per g) = 97 cm³
    - Apples: Volume of one apple is 28 cm³.
Volume of apples = 117 g × 28 cm³ per g = 3276 cm³
    - Kiwifruits: Volume of one kiwifruit is 78 cm³.
Volume of kiwifruits = 138 g × 78 cm³ per g = 10764 cm³
    - Strawberries: We know the weight of strawberries is 7/10 g per cm³.
Volume of strawberries = 86 g / (7/10 cm³ per g) = 122.86 cm³ (approximately)
Total volume = 97 cm³ + 3276 cm³ + 10764 cm³ + 122.86 cm³ ≈ 14160.86 cm³
Therefore:
- Sum of weights = 441 g
- Sum of volumes ≈ 14160.86 cm³ 🍎🥝🍓🫐   .
