Certainly! Let's find a solution. We'll denote the number of strawberries as (s), the number of oranges as (o), and the number of apples as (a).
We have the following information:
- The price of a strawberry is 94 cents: (94s).
- The price of an orange is 32 cents: (32o).
- The price of an apple is 91 cents: (91a).
- The total number of fruits is 11: (s + o + a = 11).
- The sum of the prices is 476 cents: (94s + 32o + 91a = 476).
We can set up a system of equations:
[
\begin{align*}
s + o + a &= 11 \
94s + 32o + 91a &= 476
\end{align*}
]
Let's solve this system of equations. First, we can express (s) in terms of (o) and (a):
[ s = 11 - o - a ]
Substitute this expression for (s) into the second equation:
[ 94(11 - o - a) + 32o + 91a = 476 ]
Solving for (o):
[ 94 \cdot 11 - 94o - 94a + 32o + 91a = 476 ]
[ 1038 - 62o - 3a = 476 ]
[ 62o + 3a = 562 ]
Now let's express (o) in terms of (a):
[ o = \frac{562 - 3a}{62} ]
Since the number of fruits must be a whole number, we'll check integer values of (a) that satisfy the equation. Let's start with (a = 1):
[ o = \frac{562 - 3 \cdot 1}{62} = 9 ]
Now calculate the number of strawberries:
[ s = 11 - o - a = 11 - 9 - 1 = 1 ]
And the number of apples:
[ a = 1 ]
So the shopper buys 1 strawberry, 9 oranges, and 1 apple. üçìüçäüçé
