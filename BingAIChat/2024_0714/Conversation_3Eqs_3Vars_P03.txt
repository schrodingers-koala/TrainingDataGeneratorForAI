Let's find the solution! We have three types of fruits: apples, melons, and kiwifruits. Let's denote the number of apples as (a), melons as (m), and kiwifruits as (k).
We're given the following information:
- Price of an apple: 45 cents
- Price of a melon: 78 cents
- Price of a kiwifruit: 9 cents
- Weight of an apple: 61 g
- Weight of a melon: 97 g
- Weight of a kiwifruit: 72 g
- Total number of fruits bought: 14
- Total price: 474 cents
- Total weight: 1086 g
Let's set up the equations:
- Total price equation:
[45a + 78m + 9k = 474]
- Total weight equation:
[61a + 97m + 72k = 1086]
Now let's solve this system of equations. I'll use the substitution method:
From the total price equation, we can express (k) in terms of (a) and (m):
[k = \frac{474 - 45a - 78m}{9}]
Substitute this expression for (k) into the total weight equation:
[61a + 97m + 72\left(\frac{474 - 45a - 78m}{9}\right) = 1086]
Solving for (m):
[61a + 97m + 8(474 - 45a - 78m) = 1086]
[61a + 97m + 3792 - 360a - 624m = 1086]
[36a - 527m = -1706]
[36a = 527m - 1706]
[a = \frac{527m - 1706}{36}]
Since the number of fruits is a whole number, we need to find integer solutions for (a) and (m). Let's try some values for (m):
- If (m = 1):
[a = \frac{527 - 1706}{36} = -31.5] (Not a whole number)
- If (m = 2):
[a = \frac{1054 - 1706}{36} = -15.5] (Not a whole number)
- If (m = 3):
[a = \frac{1581 - 1706}{36} = -3.5] (Not a whole number)
- If (m = 4):
[a = \frac{2108 - 1706}{36} = 11]
So, one solution is:
- Apples ((a)): 11
- Melons ((m)): 4
- Kiwifruits ((k)): (14 - 11 - 4 = 1)
Therefore, the shopper buys 11 apples, 4 melons, and 1 kiwifruit. üçéüçàü•ù
