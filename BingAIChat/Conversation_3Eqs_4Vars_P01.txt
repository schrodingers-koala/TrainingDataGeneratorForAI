Let's denote the number of melons, blueberries, kiwifruits, and apples as m, b, k, and a, respectively. We can write the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

m + b + k + a = 15
96m + 16b + 31k + 52a = 571
9m + 72b + 68k + 33a = 879

We can solve this system of equations using matrix algebra. The solution is:

m = 3
b = 6
k = 2
a = 4

Therefore, the shopper bought 3 melons, 6 blueberries, 2 kiwifruits, and 4 apples. One possible way to check this solution is to verify that it satisfies all three equations in the system.

The shopper bought 3 melons, 6 blueberries, 2 kiwifruits, and 4 apples. To calculate the total price, we can multiply the price of each fruit by the number of fruits purchased and sum the results. Using the given prices, we get:

Total price = 3 * 96 + 6 * 16 + 2 * 31 + 4 * 52 = 288 + 96 + 62 + 208 = 654 cents

Therefore, the total price of the shopper's purchase is 654 cents.
